Here's some badges I made! This also includes different position and color variations, based on preference!\

If there's any questions, [please send an ask to my tumblr!](https://www.tumblr.com/new/ask/fift33nfathoms)

Note that some badges will require 2 spaces. I will also update this as I make more badges. (which I plan to do!)

If you'd like to support me, then just interact with my content on social medias. I also take suggestions! Enjoy ♥
